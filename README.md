# JSONMapper

An iOS library supports mapping json data

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/nimblehq/JSONMapper.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
